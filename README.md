# Example CMake Project with CPack configuration

Intended as personal reference for myself.

Configures and builds en example project that prints
the current git version to the console. The cmake folder
contains several cmake modules. Modify the cpack file to
suit your needs. This project assumes you're using NSIS
as the generator when building on windows.
